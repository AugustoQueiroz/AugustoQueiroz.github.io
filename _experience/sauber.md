During CITi's CodeCup hackathon, I worked with two other people to bring to life Sauber, a platform that, besides giving people a quick access to the list of Brazilian senators, it also used twitter to judge the senator's work, by looking at tweets mentioning them and finding out whether they were positive, negative or neutral. I worked alongside a designer to create the website's front, while the other developer worked on the back-end.
