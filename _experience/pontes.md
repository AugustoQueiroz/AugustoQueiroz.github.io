duration: 2015

A friend of mine invited me to join his team for Kolks Game Jam. He was looking for another developer and I promptly accepted. We both worked on Construct 2 to bring to life <i>Pontes</i>, a game where the player was tasked with helping a collection of rain droplets to get to a river. A platformer, the game has at it's heart a rather innovative mechanic, which was the collection of droplets itself: They evaporated over time, and the player had to reach the river before his rain drop was completely gone. The game did rather well with the public, getting on the top 10 after popular vote.
