duration: 2015

During Start-Up Weekend UFPE in 2015, I came up with, and was one of the developers in, SociUp, a platform that was meant to bring together young entrepreneurs, who needed help getting their projects started, and who wanted to start networking with other aspiring entrepreneurs. I worked alongside two other developers on the front-end of the website. At the time, the two other developers were much more experienced than I was, so it was a great opportunity to grow. I worked mainly with HTML and CSS.
