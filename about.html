                    <div class="post-body">
                        <p>Hello there fellow reader, welcome to my web page. As the header of the page says, as well as the title of this section, I am Augusto. Augusto Sales de Queiroz, to be more exact. I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate student at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). I've been studying <abbr title="Computer Engineering">CE</abbr> since the first semester of 2015.</p>
                        <p>Since I first started studying CE, I've changed my mind a few times on my areas of interest, but I've always had two main areas be on my top 5: Artificial Intelligence, and Game Design and Development. I can't say that I've pushed those interests very far, but since I've started college, I've created a game during a game jam (<i>Pontes</i> is the name of the game, and it was a simple platformer where you, as a raindrop, tried to find your way to the river bank. What was really cool about it was that, instead of going with the regular sprite animation, we had particle animation for the droplet, which would evaporate separately, as well as split -  which meant you could lose part of your body by getting split in the middle. The game did quite well on popular vote, but when it came to the judges vote, we got knocked back a little). In Artificial Intelligence I've only recently acquired the confidence to actually persue more advanced knowledge, starting Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera. Other areas that I've had interest over time include Web Development, which I had experience with in 2015, when two times I participated in "hackathons" where I had to develop the Front-End of web services. I've also played around a bit with iOS development with Swift (I actually took the Treehouse course), but never got so far as to develop a complete application.</p>
                        <p>But my life isn't just made of Computer Engineering, so let's leave that aside for a little bit. As any other human being (I hope), I have many other hobbies and passions. Music is one such hobby. Besides listening to music, I also love to play the guitar (which I've been doing since 2010), and the Ukulele (which I learned more recently, in 2014). I particularly enjoy playing music with some friends, when we usually end up going all over the place, and playing all sorts of music, from the heaviest of metals, to the funkiest of funks. I also love reading, and have actually set a goal for 2017: To read at least 100 books, and try to encompass many different genres, and, most importantly, to try and take as much knowledge from each reading as possible. With music and literature gone over, I can't leave out my love of cinema and videogames. Well, the latter is probably rather obvious from my aforementioned interest in game design. But, altough perhaps not as much as literature or music, cinema is still an artform that I love, and I do end up spending lots of my free time logged on to Netflix.</p>
                        <p>In more miscelanious facts, I've been an exchange student thanks to Rotary, spending one year of High School in Burlington, Iowa, where, among many, many other things, I've managed to get my english to a fluent level. But that is the least interesting of the many things that I did while I was there. During the winter, I played JV basketball (if you know what JV is, then you might not be impressed... and you shouldn't, I'm not very good at basketball). Then, during spring I played Varsity Tennis (much more interesting, huh), while also acting in the school production of <i>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</i>. I performed in the role of Maugrim, the Wolf, chief of Her Majesty's secret police (which can't be considered so secret when they go around leaving notes that explicitly say "secret police", but oh well). Then, during the summer, I played a little bit of baseball (but just enough to get myself familiar with the game) before leaving to take a trip almost literally around the USA. Leaving from Iowa, we drove on a bus to California, going down the west cost, to cross to the other side, then go up the east coast, all the way to New York, before going back to Iowa. It was awesome. Thirty days with only a bunch of other exchange students, so many stops in so many places all over the States that it's almost impossible to pick a few favorites. Still, I can definitely say that I loved getting to visit the Grand Canyon, and watching Broadway's <i>Les Mis.</i></p>
